### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2021

+ Projec title: Did Trump win in 2016?
+ This project is conducted by Yingyao Wu

+ Project summary: It has no doubt that Trump has won the presidential election in 2016, but did he really win it or was it because his opponent Hillary Clinton has lost? In this Exploratory Data Analysis, we will explore some of the factors that might have driven the winning of Trump using the 2016 Time Series data from American National Election Studies(ANES).
